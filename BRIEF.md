# 🎯 Repository Theme

**Team Collaboration Using Git and GitHub**

## 📋 Overview

This project is a collaborative learning exercise focused on modern software development workflows using Git and GitHub. All students will contribute to a single shared repository, simulating a real-world team environment.

## 🧩 Team Organization

**Team Size:** All students divided into 2 groups

### Group 1: Project Management & GitHub Collaboration

Focus on collaboration tools and project management features

### Group 2: Git Best Practices & Development Workflow

Focus on Git discipline and healthy development practices

> **Important:** While teams are divided by focus areas, the repository structure should remain unified. The final result should appear as cohesive work without visible team boundaries.

## 🔄 Recommended Workflow

### 1. Branch Creation

Each group creates their feature branch:

- **Group 1:** `feature/project-management-collaboration`
- **Group 2:** `feature/git-best-practices`

### 2. Content Organization

- Organize content within shared folders (without indicating team ownership)
- Use the suggested structure or propose improvements collaboratively

### 3. Commit Regularly

- Make frequent commits with clear messages
- EVERY Element MUST have commits (Be aware to the commit signature!!!)
- Example: `docs: add section about pull request reviews`
- Follow conventional commit format when possible

### 4. Pull Request Submission

- Group submission must have `pw25-27` branch as target of the PR.
- Each group creates a Pull Request with their complete work
- Include a descriptive PR title and summary

### 5. Code Review

- Teams review each other's Pull Requests
- Provide constructive feedback and suggest improvements
- Practice professional review etiquette

### 6. Merge

- After approval from reviewers, perform the final merge to `pw25_27` branch

### 7. Release

- WHOLE class must create a version for the final state of the work
