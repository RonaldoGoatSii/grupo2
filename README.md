# Introduction

Welcome to the **Advanced Git Concepts** module.

While basic Git commands like `add`, `commit`, and `push` are sufficient for saving your work, professional software development requires a deeper understanding of how to curate and manage project history.





In this module, we will move beyond the basics and master three powerful strategies to maintain a pristine repository:

1.  **Git Rebase:** To maintain a linear, easy-to-read history.
2.  **Git Squash:** To condense noisy "work in progress" steps into polished features.
3.  **Git Cherry-pick:** To surgically move specific commits across branches without merging unwanted code.
